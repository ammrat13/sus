# Push the Docker Image
#
# This workflow simply exists to push the development image to DockerHub. The
# username is known, and the password is stored as a secret.
#
# TODO: As it stands, the action is using my personal access token for
# DockerHub. It would be nice to have a dedicated token, but having more than
# the one costs money. It would be nice to deal with this
